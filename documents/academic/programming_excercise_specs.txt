Project:
Functional Battleship game with Haskell

Codename:
Torpedoboats

todo: 
- implement the game (Battleship) using the language (Haskell)
	- game board printer
	- input parser with support for
		- game mechanics
			- placing ships
			- shooting
		- dev time commands
			- print opponent's ship placement
	- win/lose condition checking
	- "ai" which randomly shoots until it hits ship
	- basic logic for game mechanics (hits, coordinates, adjacency)
- test the game and assure that it behaves as intended
- document how you used the language (Haskell) and paradigm (lazy functional programming)
